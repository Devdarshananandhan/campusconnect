## Implementation Details

### Frontend Implementation

#### 1. Type Definitions (`frontend/src/types/index.ts`)
```typescript
export type UserRole = 'student' | 'alumni' | 'faculty' | 'employer' | 'recruiter';

export interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  role: UserRole;
  profile: UserProfile;
  companyId?: string; // For employers/recruiters
  // ... other fields
}

export interface UserProfile {
  name: string;
  avatar?: string;
  major?: string; // For students
  department?: string; // For faculty
  jobTitle?: string; // For employers/recruiters
  graduationYear?: number; // For students/alumni
  company?: string; // For alumni/employers/recruiters
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### 2. Permission Utility (`frontend/src/utils/rolePermissions.ts`)

**Core Functions**:
- `getRolePermissions(role)`: Returns all 15 permission flags for a role
- `hasPermission(role, permission)`: Check if role has specific permission
- `canAccessView(role, view)`: Check if role can access a specific view
- `getRoleDisplayName(role)`: Get human-readable role name
- `getRoleBadgeColor(role)`: Get Tailwind CSS classes for role badge

**Permission Flags** (15 total):
1. `canPostJobs` - Employer, Recruiter
2. `canApplyToJobs` - Student, Alumni
3. `canViewEmployerDashboard` - Employer, Recruiter
4. `canViewApplicants` - Employer, Recruiter
5. `canRequestReferrals` - Student, Alumni
6. `canProvideReferrals` - Alumni, Faculty, Employer, Recruiter
7. `canUseMentorship` - Student, Alumni, Faculty
8. `canReviewCompanies` - Student, Alumni
9. `canAccessKnowledgeHub` - All roles
10. `canAttendEvents` - All roles
11. `canJoinGroups` - All roles
12. `canMessage` - All roles
13. `canViewProfile` - All roles
14. `canEditOwnProfile` - All roles
15. `canViewLeaderboard` - All roles

#### 3. UI Components Updated

**Header** (`frontend/src/components/shared/Header.tsx`):
- ✅ Displays role badge next to user name
- ✅ Uses `getRoleDisplayName()` for readable role text
- ✅ Uses `getRoleBadgeColor()` for visual distinction

**Sidebar** (`frontend/src/components/shared/Sidebar.tsx`):
- ✅ Filters menu items based on `canAccessView()`
- ✅ Only shows menu items user has permission to access
- ✅ Receives `currentUser` prop from Dashboard

**Dashboard** (`frontend/src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`):
- ✅ Passes `currentUser` to Sidebar
- ✅ Validates view access on route change
- ✅ Redirects to feed if user tries to access unauthorized view

**JobsPage** (`frontend/src/components/careers/JobsPage.tsx`):
- ✅ Conditionally renders "Post Job" button
- ✅ Uses `hasPermission(role, 'canPostJobs')` check
- ✅ Only employers/recruiters see the button

**Register** (`frontend/src/components/auth/Register.tsx`):
- ✅ Updated with 5 role options
- ✅ Conditional form fields:
  - Student: major, graduationYear
  - Alumni: company, graduationYear
  - Faculty: department
  - Employer/Recruiter: company, jobTitle
- ✅ Includes jobTitle in profile submission for employers/recruiters

### Backend Implementation

#### 1. User Model (`backend/src/models/User.ts`)
```typescript
role: {
  type: String,
  enum: ['student', 'alumni', 'faculty', 'employer', 'recruiter'],
  required: true,
},
companyId: {
  type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: 'Company',
  required: function() {
    return this.role === 'employer' || this.role === 'recruiter';
  }
},
profile: {
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  avatar: String,
  major: String,
  department: String,
  jobTitle: String, // NEW: For employers/recruiters
  graduationYear: Number,
  company: String,
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### 2. Auth Middleware (`backend/src/middleware/auth.ts`)

**Middleware Functions**:
1. `isAuthenticated` - Verify user is logged in
2. `hasRole(...allowedRoles)` - Generic role checker
3. `isEmployer` - Check if user is employer or recruiter
4. `canApplyToJobs` - Check if user is student or alumni
5. `canProvideReferrals` - Check if user can provide referrals
6. `canMentor` - Check if user can mentor

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
router.post('/api/jobs', isAuthenticated, isEmployer, async (req, res) => {
  // Only employers and recruiters can access this route
});
```

#### 3. Protected Routes

**Jobs Routes** (`backend/src/routes/jobs.ts`):
- ✅ `POST /api/jobs` - `isEmployer` middleware
- ✅ `PUT /api/jobs/:id` - `isEmployer` middleware
- ✅ `DELETE /api/jobs/:id` - `isEmployer` middleware
- ✅ `GET /api/jobs/:id/applications` - `isEmployer` middleware

**Applications Routes** (`backend/src/routes/applications.ts`):
- ✅ `POST /api/applications` - `canApplyToJobs` middleware
- ✅ `PUT /api/applications/:id/status` - `isEmployer` middleware

- [ ] All roles can access Groups
- [ ] All roles can access Knowledge Hub
- [ ] All roles can access Messages

- [ ] All roles see correct role badge in Header

### Security Tests
- [ ] Direct URL access to unauthorized views redirects to feed
- [ ] API endpoints reject requests from unauthorized roles
- [ ] Students cannot POST to /api/jobs
- [ ] Employers cannot POST to /api/applications
- [ ] Faculty cannot access job application endpoints
- [ ] Role badge cannot be spoofed on frontend

### UI/UX Tests
- [ ] Role badge displays correctly in Header
- [ ] Sidebar filters menu items correctly
- [ ] No unauthorized menu items visible
- [ ] "Post Job" button only visible to employers/recruiters
- [ ] Smooth transitions when accessing different views
- [ ] Console warnings when accessing unauthorized views

## Security Considerations

1. **Frontend Validation**: UI hides unauthorized features but doesn't rely on it for security
2. **Backend Enforcement**: All routes protected with appropriate middleware
3. **Role Verification**: User role verified on every protected request
4. **Session Management**: Role stored in user session, verified server-side
5. **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures role values are valid
6. **Double-Check**: Both view-level and component-level permission checks

## Future Enhancements

1. **Granular Permissions**: Move to permission-based system instead of role-based
2. **Custom Roles**: Allow admins to create custom roles
3. **Role Hierarchies**: Implement role inheritance
4. **Audit Logging**: Log all role-based access attempts
5. **Admin Role**: Add super-admin role for platform management
6. **Multi-Role Users**: Allow users to have multiple roles
7. **Company Admin**: Add role for company admins to manage recruiters
